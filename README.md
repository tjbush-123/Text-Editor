## Description

My motivation for this project was to expand my knowledge on PWA. I built this project so i can learn the elements for indexedDB. This solves the problem of learning the basics of PWA. I learned how to use PWA on my own.

## Installation

To get started clone this repository run npm i to install all the necessary files with Webpack, Express, and Nodemon.
```
git@github.com:tjbush-123/Text-Editor.git
```

## Usage

The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Credits

This was a solo project
